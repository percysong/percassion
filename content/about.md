*percassion* is a marriage of percy and cassie, an intangible space for collecting photographs we love and would like to share.

we've always wanted something special and intimate for ourselves. it could be a testimony of the memory and love we both share, or, it could simply be a perspective, a lens, through which the world reflects itself by the parameters of our minds.

slow, useless and inconvenient a website can be, it is never fragmented or decontextualized. it is an integral and organic whole. it is never limited or restricted. it is freedom in a sense that one could achieve in a more and more centralized and AI filtered age.

hope you find beauty, peace and love. here, there and everywhere.
